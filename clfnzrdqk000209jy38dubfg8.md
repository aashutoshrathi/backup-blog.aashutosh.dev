👋🏻 Hola, Long time no see! (*first time for most of you TBH*)

### Starting from the start

I have been having *a* **hard time writing full-blown blog posts** (*having 4 great posts in drafts from the last year)*.

I know it might be too late to enter the content creation space, but lately, I have been very much active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AashutoshRathi) and have been tweeting a lot and mainly of the tweet are Series of [#TIL](https://aashutosh.dev/til/) (Today I Learned) and I curate them using a query later on my [website](https://aashutosh.dev).

Meanwhile, I <s>do</s> don't want to drop the plan of completing the **big** blog posts, I have been reading and chirping (*tweeting*) a lot lately.

### Coming to the point

That brings me to the point of starting something inspired by [Seth Godin's blog](https://seths.blog/), which is to ***write more and write short pieces*** (*don't force me to tell you about your attention span*) that are easily consumable in this fast-moving space.

So, I plan to write small posts (*ideally, will come up with a pattern dividing the whole post into 4 categories*) called **"Nibble"** (*coz why not*).

#### What is Nibble?

In computing, a nibble is a four-bit aggregation or half an octet. It is also known as a half-byte or trade.

If you are already subscribed and receiving this one in your mailbox (*thanks!*), stay tuned!  
Haven't decided on frequency yet ([Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/AashutoshRathi/status/1639617444917518341))

### Why start now?

( \* *4 years after buying the domain??* 🤫 \*)

Well, [something](https://daily.dev/blog/seed-round) has sparked the fire in my heart, and I realized that writing content is a good *way to get criticized* and make sure you have learned *at least* the objective things correctly.

Also,

* I have been enjoying writing professionally and starting to like putting more *life force* into it for the past ~1 year.
    
* Few of the major bummers was not able to come up with good headline, logos, or banners. I think the new cool kids' tools (MidJourney and bois) are gonna help me with that.
    
* I have been reading more than before, and I need this to be my <s>rough</s> notebook on the internet 😌.
    

yeah, a bit of a selfish move. (*don't want to lose my "full-time passion, which brings me a money" job to ChatGPT*).

BTW, for the uninitiated, I have been building some finger muscles 💪🏻 writing ***Release Notes*** *(as if it were part of my JD)* at [Regie](https://regie.ai).

And I have introduced something there called **GaaS (Good Vibes as a Service):**

which means that everything *inside the (round brackets and in italics)* is a purely fun take to make sure you giggle while you consume the important parts and the content is sending good vibes across the globe.

### What to expect?

Well, mostly the plan is to figure out the way, but the main bits will be Tech, Dev Toolings, Life, and News that matters. (*I read almost ~12-17 newsletters every day, will try to keep this one with the least duplicate content*)

#### Credits where it's due

Thanks to [Mohit](https://only4.dev) ✨ for helping me convert the logo idea to reality and [Pushkar](https://www.thepushkarp.com/) 🤝 has been helping me push (*as the name suggests*) myself all this time for writing, so, if you don't like a post, go blame him, he might have said "LGTM 👍🏻" before I published.

Godspeed 🖖🏻
