    Well, [**Matt Welsh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Welsh_(computer_scientist)) says "no more than 3 years", it'll change as we know it and Co-pilot might soon take the main seat.
    
* 👀 Code Reviews are hard, but the best way to learn uncharted code, apart from breaking it. [**Kamran**](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) (*the person behind* [***Developer Roadmaps***](https://roadmap.sh/)*)* released a quick new guide on how to [**Review Code**](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/code-reviews)

### New in town 👀

* [**Supaglue**](https://www.supaglue.com/) - The Open Source Unified API for CRM integrations
    
* [**AI Marketplace**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ai-marketplace-by-zentask-ai) - A platform where you can create prompts and earn commissions.
    
* [**Lamini**](https://lamini.ai/) - Fine-tuning is stale, make your LLM instead.
    

### Recommendations 💫

* [**Map of Reddit**](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/?x=18239&y=12514&z=46488.09635705632&v=2) - if you ever found it difficult to explore Reddit (*any human should)* this tool gives you beautiful
    
* [**Jellylade**](https://app.jellylade.com/) - An app that lets you turn your screenshots into beautiful posts with device frames
    
* [**Programmable Search Engine**](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com) - This tool by Google provides you the ability to add top-level filters and then use an API to make custom searches, which are most relevant to you or your end user.
    

### Cool OSS Projects 🤌🏻

* [**Track Anything**](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything) - It's more or less now a ritual to talk about [SAM](https://segment-anything.com/) (*sometimes Altman, sometimes the model by Meta*) in every edition. This cool project lets you track and segment objects in a video, it uses SAM (*the model*) and XMem
    
* [**art-of-command-line**](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - A one-page README to master CLI commands. (*but yeah who needs it after Copilot CLI? Well, trust me, I have been using it for 2 months now, and it is better if you learn these basics*)
    
* [**cobe**](https://github.com/shuding/cobe) - 5kb WebGL Globe Lib, which *improves perf by* ***&gt;60%***. ([**How it was made?**](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1475916082875666441?s=20)) (*optimizations are hard, and UI optimizations are harder, as it involves engines and renderers beyond your scope of tasks, so when you hear WebGL & optimizations in the same line, you gotta respect that.*)
