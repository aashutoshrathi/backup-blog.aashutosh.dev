üëãüèª Hola! Welcome to the #1 edition of Nibble.

Let's make sure we have our seatbelts on, this is gonna be a long & overwhelmingly distracting ride. üé¢

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** it's more like an octet (*instead of a nibble*) now!  
So, I recommend you bookmark this post, in case you can't go through all of them at once.

### Catch up with the tech ü§ì

* üìπ [Transformers, explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZorAJ4I-sA) by [Dale from Google](https://twitter.com/dalequark), explains how ***Transforms*** work way faster and are more context-aware than RNNs, kudos to **Self-attention** ([AIAYN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))
    
* üìπ [LLM explainer from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnA9DMvHtfI&t=0s) is by far the best explainer I have seen, the guy takes you from Gradient Descent -&gt; NN -&gt; Transformers -&gt; AGI in a small amount of time.
    
* üìÑ [Visual Guide to Event Loop](https://www.builder.io/blog/visual-guide-to-nodejs-event-loop), the core of NodeJS, has always been one of the interesting topics to read, but there are barely any good resources out there on the internet. The folks at [builder.io](https://www.builder.io) have been writing some good technical blogs, no doubt.
    
* üìÑ [Cross-browser support landed for Import Maps](https://web.dev/import-maps-in-all-modern-browsers/), a saner way to use ES Modules in browsers, not sure how long the builders gonna last in my stack. You can read why do we care article here
    
* üê• [NativeScript announced support for jQuery](https://twitter.com/NativeScript/status/1642059224963485696) (*yup, in 2023*)
    

### "Today I Learned" moments ü§Ø

* You can throw `string` instead of `Error` objects in almighty JavaScript. (*I'm at the point in life, where I'm confused if "No Rules, Rules" was deliberately written for JS*)
    
    ```typescript
    const nibbleOne = () => {
      const nibble = 0x0F;
      // throw new Error('Nibble one'); ‚úÖ works
      // throw "Nibble one"; ‚úÖ works
    }
    ```
    
* ***Do you know how the "auto-adjust backlit brightness"*** ‚å®Ô∏è ***works?***  
    this story goes long back (*jk, barely 3 years*) to my undergrad days, I used to think that nothing is gonna stop me once I get a device with a backlit keyboard as I can then type like [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen) even in the darkest to the times.
    
    ![Apple Keyboard Settings](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680427701020/a1d05580-8025-45fe-8cfc-f1f6f2f01d6d.png align="center")
    
    Okay, no worries, you can guess it for the starters.  
    To me, naturally, it makes sense that if I have light in the environment the keyboard's backlit, should dim itself (*as opposed to how we treat screens, right?)* and once I have low light in the environment the keyboard should litt itself up (*like <s>Louis from Suits</s> exactly opposite of screen*), but **NO**, that's not how it works, at least for Apple.
    
    And knowing this all it's very easy to conclude that it might be that your device is buggy, but worry not, Reddit folks got us covered on this one: [Why your auto-adjust of keyboard backlit might not be working?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pl2mzq/comment/iavxdht/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    
* [Why do you see √¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ instead of an apostrophe](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-to-get-from-theyre-to-theyre/), got a bug at work, where CSVs were behaving <s>like a bad bad boy</s> as they should?
    
* [ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS), yup Denial of Services using Regex, and you are more vulnerable to this than you think you are. On a casual Friday walk to AWS Inspector, while at work I saw a [Medium Vuln with word-wrap](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-WORDWRAP-3149973), I quickly dug deeper into this one and found out it's a dependency of ***eslint*** (*so might be affecting half the world*)*.*  
    Proposed a fix for this in [this Pull Request](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/word-wrap/pull/33), basically to *avoid using Regex where things can be done without it*.

### New tools in town üëÄ

* [CoScreen](https://www.coscreen.co/) by Datadog, beware devs and designers, the hand-holding meme is closer to reality now. Watch the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gltVKtxcM)
    
    ![Pin on Design Memes](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/7c/ae/b8/7caeb8d2e404b301795f86c107c3678a.jpg align="center")
    
* [Arc for iOS](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662130/arc-mobile-browser-hands-on-ios), the new browser for *cool kid****z***, yes it can now be found on [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arc-mobile-companion/id1669785846) and this will be a big step as one missing piece earlier for cross-device sync. I've been using this since its release, if you are still not in yet, here's an [invite](https://arc.net/gift/9c7b51c0).  
    Oh! on that note, you might also want to listen to a Stackoverflow Podcast with Arc Team - [**The next-gen web browser has no tabs, only spaces (Ep. 549)**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/03/28/the-next-gen-web-browser-has-no-tabs-only-spaces-ep-549/)
    
* [**Regex.ai**](https://regex.ai/)**,** AI-Powered Regular Expression Solver. (*yup! just marked one more skill as irrelevant on my resume*)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680433893904/e99546e8-ac41-4d84-a097-6805f4aeb8bf.gif align="center")
    

### Tools Recommendations üí´

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (*your own "Dear Diary"*) with [Git Sync Plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) (started post little push and marketing pitch from [Kautuk](https://twitter.com/Kautukkundan) & [only4](http://only4.dev))
    
* [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/) (*imagine, a screen memory with ChatGPT*), found it on Twitter, installed it, and thought would give it a try. But, funny story, in mere 3 days, it saved from unrecoverable states **twice**, one should give it a try *iff* you trust their [policies](https://www.rewind.ai/privacy-first).
    
* [Raycast AI](https://www.raycast.com/ai) (*joined the party a little late*)*,* this is a game changer, you will soon realize how lazy you are as soon as you get access to this, there is no going back to ai.com (*yup, Mr. Altman is doing some serious domain shopping*).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680430274383/261d0e93-3fcf-4921-bff8-27205a3a1c8e.png align="center")
    
* [Hacker News Arc Boost](https://github.com/kslambert/hacker-news-arc-boost), technically it's just a CSS file, but it improves the page so much (*if you are using Arc or not, I recommend injecting this stylesheet*)
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-10-30 at 4 09 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3496059/198906404-e67e3e8a-5810-4aa2-8b33-dc3d24c1f485.png align="left")
    

### Fin-bits

(*this section is to share informative things I read, not a fin-fluencer,* ***<s>yet!!</s>****, so go do your research before trading based on things you read on the internet*)

* [Tata Technologies IPO Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyo8915RzUU), no doubt this is one of the most exciting IPO coming up, and if you are by any chance like me scarred by [LIC](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/prime/money-and-markets/a-30-fall-since-listing-how-lics-ipo-became-indias-biggest-wealth-destroyer/primearticleshow/92212792.cms) (\*sad crying noises\*)
    

### A quote that got me thinking

### Note

Look! this might have been a long one, but trust me when I say this, I *held back from sharing more links*, as it might be redundant for folks who read other newsletters too. üòÖ  
Also, yes I remember telling you it'll be *4 sections and a quick read* ü´†, but I think we can't make it smaller, if weekly is the frequency we choose. And regarding the shrinking down the sections, I'll work on it in the coming editions.

**On the same note**, I think this one should keep you occupied for a week and a half, as I'll be taking <s>some time off-screen</s>, touching grass ‚õµÔ∏è for *a week* exploring üéí the beautiful *North Eastern part of India* üáÆüá≥
