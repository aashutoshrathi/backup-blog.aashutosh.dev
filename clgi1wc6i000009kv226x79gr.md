### New tools in town üëÄ

* [PWA Builder](https://web.dev/pwas-in-app-stores/) helps you to build packages out of PWA that can be distributed to Google, MS & Apple Store (*so, we have 1 good and 1 bad news, it'll be easy to distribute your web apps and it'll be easy to distribute your web apps*)

### Tools Recommendations üí´

* [RClone](https://rclone.org/): a CLI tool to manage your files on the cloud that supports all major storage providers (*this one has a crazy amount of features in it, oh! and yes it comes with an experimental Web-based GUI too*)
    
* [ProxyMan](https://proxyman.io/): A simple tool that lets you monitor all the network requests going out from your computer (*this is pretty nifty at times, it basically creates a proxy that gives you the ability to intercept all the requests, save lives & hack stuff sometimes too*)
    
* [Gamma](https://gamma.app/): It's a new way to communicate ideas, I have been using this at work for a while. (*can't say it'll replace any app from your workflow, but you can try it out*)
    

### Watching üì∫

* [AlphaGo - The Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) - this one will surprisingly bring water to your eyes, it's one hell of a gripping documentary, and also reminds us of how early we started addressing AI as some unpredictable human (*I mean long before GeePeeTee*)

### Note

This newsletter might be a little stale, but the next one will come a little early as I want to keep it shorter and we are lagging by a week.  
Also, I know some of you told me to tweak the banner designs a bit, I'll try to get it done by the next one.
